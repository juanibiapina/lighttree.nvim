INTRODUCTION                                             *neo-tree-introduction*

Neo-tree is a plugin for nvim that can display tree structures in a sidebar,
floating window, or in a split. The current version includes a filesystem
browser, a buffer list, and a git status view.


COMMANDS                                       *:Neotree*  *neo-tree-commands*

Neo-tree does not define any default keybindings for nvim. The suggested
keybindings are:

    nnoremap | :Neotree reveal<cr>
    nnoremap gd :Neotree float reveal_file=<cfile>

The single |:Neotree| command accepts a range of arguments that give you full
control over the details of what and where it will show. Arguments can be
specified as either a key=value pair or just as the value. The key=value form
is more verbose but may help with clarity.
<
These arguments can be specified in any order. Here is the full list of 
arguments you can use:

dir~
The directory to set as the root/cwd of the specified window. If you include a
directory as one of the arguments, it will be assumed to be this option, you
don't need the full dir=/path. You may use any value that can be passed to the
'expand' function, such as `%:p:h:h` to specify two directories up from the
current file.

git_base~
The base that is used to calculate the git status for each dir/file.
By default it uses `HEAD`, so it shows all changes that are not yet committed.
You can for example work on a feature branch, and set it to `main`. It will
show all changes that happened on the feature branch and main since you 
branched off.

Any git ref, commit, tag, or sha will work.

reveal~
This is a boolean flag. Adding this will make Neotree automatically find and 
focus the current file when it opens.

reveal_path~
A path to a file to reveal. This supersedes the "reveal" flag so there is no
need to specify both. Use this if you want to reveal something other than the
current file. If you include a path to a file as one of the arguments, it will
be assumed to be this option. Like "dir", you can pass any value that can be
passed to the 'expand' function.

MAPPINGS                                                                      ~
===============================================================================
                                                            *neo-tree-mappings*

HELP                                                            *neo-tree-help*

? = show_help: Shows a popup window with all of the mappings for the current
               Neotree window. Pressing one of those keys will close the help
               screen and execute the chosen command in the original Neotree
               window. NOTE that selecting a line in the help window and
               pressing enter will not execute that command, it will just
               execute whatever the enter key is mapped to.


NAVIGATION                                                *neo-tree-navigation*

Within the neo-tree window, for the filesystem source, the following mappings
are defined by default. All built-in commands are listed here but some are not 
mapped by default. See |neo-tree-custom-commands| for details on how to use them
in a custom mapping.

Note: The "selected" item is the line the cursor is currently on.

<bs>          = navigate_up: Moves the root directory up one level.

.             = set_root:    Changes the root directory to the currently 
                             selected folder.

<space>       = toggle_node  Expand or collapse a node with children, which
                             may be a directory or a nested file.

<2-LeftMouse> = open:        Expand or collapse a folder. If a file is selected,
                             open it in the window closest to the tree.

<cr>          = open:        Same as above.

C             = close_node:  Close node if it is open, else close it's parent.

z         = close_all_nodes: Close all nodes in the tree.

         close_all_subnodes: Same as "close_node", but also recursively collapse
                             all subnodes, similar to "close_all_nodes"

           expand_all_nodes: Expand all directory nodes in the tree recursively.

                  open_drop: Same as open, but opens with the |:drop| command. 

[g      = prev_git_modified: Jump to the previous file reported by `git status`
                             that is within the current working directory.
                             This will loop around if you are on the last one.

]g      = next_git_modified: Jump to the next file reported by `git status`
                             that is within the current working directory.
                             This will loop around if you are on the last one.


FILE ACTIONS                                            *neo-tree-file-actions*
a    = add:                  Create a new file OR directory. Add a `/` to the
                             end of the name to make a directory. This command
                             supports an optional `config.show_path` option
                             which controls what portion of the path is shown
                             in the prompt. The choices for this option are:

                             `"none"`:     which is the default.
                             `"relative"`: shows the portion which is relative
                                         to the current root of the tree.
                             `"absolute"`: is the full path to the current
                                         directory.

                             The file path also supports BASH style brace
                             expansion. sequence style ("{00..05..2}") as well
                             as nested braces. Here are some examples how this
                             expansion works.

                             "x{a..e..2}"           : "xa", "xc", "xe"
                             "file.txt{,.bak}"      : "file.txt", "file.txt.bak"
                             "./{a,b}/{00..02}.lua" : "./a/00.lua", "./a/01.lua",
                                                      "./a/02.lua", "./b/00.lua",
                                                      "./b/01.lua", "./b/02.lua"

A    = add_directory:        Create a new directory, in this mode it does not
                             need to end with a `/`. The path also supports
                             BASH style brace expansion as explained in `add`
                             command. Also accepts `config.show_path` options

d    = delete:               Delete the selected file or directory.
                             Supports visual selection.~

r    = rename:               Rename the selected file or directory.

y    = copy_to_clipboard:    Mark file to be copied.
                             Supports visual selection.~

x    = cut_to_clipboard:     Mark file to be cut (moved).
                             Supports visual selection.~

p    = paste_from_clipboard: Copy/move each marked file to the selected folder.

c    = copy:                 Copy the selected file or directory.
                             Also accepts the optional `config.show_path` option
                             like the add file action.

m    = move:                 Move the selected file or directory.
                             Also accepts the optional `config.show_path` option
                             like the add file action.


VIEW CHANGES                                            *neo-tree-view-changes*
H = toggle_hidden: Toggle whether hidden (filtered items) are shown or not.

R = refresh:       Rescan the filesystem and redraw the tree. Changes made 
                   within nvim should be detected automatically, but this is
                   useful for changes made elsewhere.


CUSTOM MAPPINGS                                       *neo-tree-custom-mappings*

If you want to change the mappings, you can do so in two places. Mappings
defined in `window.mappings` apply to all sources, and mappings defined at the
source level, such as `filesystem.window.mappings` will override and extend
those global mappings for that particular source. 

For example:
>lua
   require("neo-tree").setup({
     window = {
       mappings = {
         ["A"] = "command_a"
       }
     },
     filesystem = {
       window = {
         mappings = {
           ["A"] = "command_b"
         }
       }
     }
   })
<
The above config will map `A` to command_a for all sources except for
filesystem, which will use command_b instead.

If you don't want to use *any* default mappings, you can set
`use_default_mappings = false` in your config.

If you want to remove one or more particular default mappings, you can map
the sequence to `none` or `noop:

>lua
   require("neo-tree").setup({
     filesystem = {
       window = {
         mappings = {
           ["?"] = "noop"
         }
       }
     }
   })
<

NOTE: Not all commands work for all sources. If it is defined in the source
section in the default config instead of at the root level, that means it is
specific to that source and will not work for others.


CUSTOM COMMANDS                                       *neo-tree-custom-commands*

If you want to define your own command, you have two options:
  1. You can define (or override) a command in the `commands` section of the
  config for each source, then reference that by name in a mapping.
  2. You can map directly to a function and skip defining a command.

You probably want #2:
>lua
   require("neo-tree").setup({
     filesystem = {
       window = {
         mappings = {
           ["?"] = function(state)
             local node = state.tree:get_node()
             print(node.name)
           end
         }
       }
     }
   })
<
..or
>lua
   local print_me = function(state)
     local node = state.tree:get_node()
     print(node.name)
   end

   require("neo-tree").setup({
     filesystem = {
       window = {
         mappings = {
           ["?"] = print_me
         }
       }
     }
   })
<
...but if you want #1, here is how that works:

>lua
   require("neo-tree").setup({
     filesystem = {
       commands = {
         print_me = function(state)
           local node = state.tree:get_node()
           print(node.name)
         end
       },
       mappings = {
         ["?"] = "print_me"
       }
     }
   })
<

CUSTOM MAPPINGS WITH VISUAL MODE

If you want to create a mapping that supports visual mode, the way to do that
is to add a second command where the name is the same as the normal mode
command, but with `_visual` added to the end. Any mapping for this command will
then work in either normal or visual mode.

The `_visual` version of the command will be called with a second argument
which is a list of the nodes that were selected when the command was called.

For example, this is how the built-in `delete` command is defined:

>lua
    M.delete = function(state, callback)
      local tree = state.tree
      local node = tree:get_node()
      fs_actions.delete_node(node.path, callback)
    end

    M.delete_visual = function(state, selected_nodes, callback)
      local paths_to_delete = {}
      for _, node_to_delete in pairs(selected_nodes) do
        table.insert(paths_to_delete, node_to_delete.path)
      end
      fs_actions.delete_nodes(paths_to_delete, callback)
    end
<

CUSTOM MAPPINGS WITH ARGUMENTS

If you want to include options for your mappings, such as `nowait`, you can
set this for all mappings using the `mapping_options` key, or on individual
mappings by specifying them as a table that consists of the command and any
options you want to use. If both are specified, the mapping merges with and
overrides the global `mapping_options`

The command can be either the string name of a built-in command, or a
function, and is specified either as the first element in the table or by
assigning it to the `command` key:
>lua
   require("neo-tree").setup({
     filesystem = {
       window = {
         mapping_options = {
            noremap = true,
            nowait = false,
         },
         mappings = {
           ["?"] = {
             function(state)
               local node = state.tree:get_node()
               print(node.name)
             end,
             nowait = true
           },
           ["i"] = {
             command = function(state)
               local node = state.tree:get_node()
               print(node.name)
             end,
             nowait = true
           },
           ["o"] = {
             command = "open",
             nowait = true
           },
           ["O"] = {
             "open",
             nowait = true
           },
         }
       }
     }
   })
<
See |:map-arguments| for possible values to include. "buffer" and "nnoremap"
are enabled by default.

CUSTOM MAPPINGS WITH CONFIG

Some mappings may accept an optional `config` table to control it's behavior.
When that is the case, the command is specified using the table syntax, and
the config options are in a table bound to the `config` key:
>lua
   require("neo-tree").setup({
     filesystem = {
       window = {
         mappings = {
           ["a"] = {
             "add",
             nowait = true
             config = {
               show_path = "none" -- "none", "relative", "absolute"
             }
           },
         }
       }
     }
   })
<
When the `config` key is used, it is added to the `state` argument that is
passed to the command function:
>lua
    M.add = function(state, callback)
      local show_path = state.config.show_path
      ...
<

================================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                                  ~
================================================================================
                                                        *neo-tree-configuration*
Neo-tree is highly configurable and you should be able to make it do whatever
you want without having to change the internal code. Here are the ways you can
customize it:

By setting config options in the |neo-tree-setup| function. This is for very
common items and is how you would configure most lua plugins. You can also
change the look by configuring the appropriate highlight groups, see
|neo-tree-highlights|.

By creating custom mappings (see |neo-tree-mappings|). You can of course just
change what keys are mapped to which built-in functions, but you can also map
keys to a custom function and do whatever you want. See the wiki for some
examples: https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim/wiki/Recipes#commands

By hooking into |neo-tree-events|. You can do things like always clear the
search after opening a file, or define a custom file opener to choose what
window will be used, or respond to file events like renames and moves.

By configuring, rearranging, adding, or removing |neo-tree-renderers| for each
node type. The renderer is a list of components, such as "icon" and "name",
which determines how each node displayed. Use them as lego pieces to build what
you want to see.

By adding or replacing |neo-tree-components|. Components are the functions
called by the renderers, and they return the text and highlight group to be
displayed. If you want to gather extra data just once per render to be used by a
custom component, you can do so in the "before_render" event (see
|neo-tree-events|), set that data on the `state` object, and reference it in the
component. See the wiki for some examples of custom components:
https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim/wiki/Recipes#components


SETUP                                                           *neo-tree-setup*

To override the defaults or add new functionality, call the setup() function
with your overrides. For example, to add your own mappings in 'lua':

>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      filesystem = {
        window = {
          mappings = {
            ["<F5>"] = "refresh",
            ["o"] = "open",
          }
        }
      }
    })
<

NOTE: The mappings you define will be merged with the default mappings. If you
wish to remove a default mapping without overriding it with your own function,
assign it the the string "none". This will cause it to be skipped and allow any
existing global mappings to work.


CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY                                         *neo-tree-cwd*

Neo-tree will maintain a one-way binding between the cwd of nvim and the root of
the tree. Changing the current working directory of nvim will change the root in
Neo-tree.


FILTERED ITEMS                                         *neo-tree-filtered-items*

The `filesystem` source has a `filtered_items` section in it's config that
allows you to specify what files and folders should be hidden. By default, any
item identified by these filters will not be visible, but that visibility can
be toggled on and off with a command. Each type of filter has a corresponding
highlight group which will be applied when they are visible, see 
|neo-tree-highlights| for details. The following options are available:

>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      filesystem = {
        filtered_items = {
          visible = false, -- when true, they will just be displayed differently than normal items
          hide_dotfiles = true,
          hide_gitignored = true,
          hide_hidden = true, -- only works on Windows for hidden files/directories
          hide_by_name = {
            ".DS_Store",
            "thumbs.db",
            --"node_modules",
          },
          hide_by_pattern = {
            --"*.meta",
            --"*/src/*/tsconfig.json",
          },
          always_show = { -- remains visible even if other settings would normally hide it
            --".gitignored",
          },
          never_show = { -- remains hidden even if visible is toggled to true, this overrides always_show
            --".DS_Store",
            --"thumbs.db",
          },
          never_show_by_pattern = { -- uses glob style patterns
            --".null-ls_*",
          },
        },
      }
    })
<

The `visible` option just defines the default value. This value is toggled by
the "toggle_hidden" command, which is mapped to H by default.

The `hide_dotfiles` option just hides anything that starts with `. `(period).

The `hide_gitignored` option will query git for the files and folders being
shown, and hide those that are marked as ignored.

The `hide_hidden` option only will work on Windows using the Windows logic
that determines if a file or directory is hidden.

The `hide_by_name` option is a list of file/folder names that should be
hidden. This is an exact match.

The `hide_by_pattern` option uses glob syntax, which is converted to lua
patterns. No guarantees on how it handles advanced patterns.

The `always_show` option is a list of file/folder names that will always be 
visible, even if other settings would normally hide it. This section takes
precedence over all other options except for `never_show`.

The `never_show` option is the same as `hide_by_name`, except that those items
will remain hidden even if you toggle `visible` to true. This section takes
precedence over the others.

The `never_show_by_pattern` option is the same as `hide_by_pattern`, except that
those items will remain hidden even if you toggle `visible` to true. This
section takes precedence over the others.


NETRW HIJACK BEHAVIOR                                    *neo-tree-netrw-hijack*

Neo-tree can and does hijack Netrw by default. This is configurable and can be
disabled if you use Netrw, or have other plugins that use Netrw functionality.
This can be controlled by setting the `hijack_netrw` option.

    require("neo-tree").setup({
      hijack_netrw = true,
                  -- false,
    })
<

COMPONENT CONFIGS                                   *neo-tree-component-configs*

The visual display of a node is made up of a series of components rendered in a
certain order and with certain configuration options. See |neo-tree-components|
for a deeper dive into customizing this aspect. If you wish to configure those
components in a universal way, the best place to do that is in the
`default_component_configs` section of the config.

For example, to add indent markers, you can apply your settings in each renderer
for each source, or just do it once in the default_component_configs section:

>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      default_component_configs = {
        indent = {
          with_markers = true,
          indent_marker = "│",
          last_indent_marker = "└",
          indent_size = 2,
        },
      },
    })
<
See |neo-tree-indent-markers| for more details.

The default config has more examples of component configuration, use
|NeoTreePasteConfig| to view that default config.


GIT STATUS                                                 *neo-tree-git-status*

By default, Neo-tree will attempt to get the git status for files in the
current directory. It will use this information to add markers to the right of
your files, and will set the highlight groups of files and directories.

To disable this feature entirely, set `enable_git_status = false` in your
config when calling the setup function. To just disable colors on file or
directory names, you can set `use_git_status_colors = false` in the `name`
component of your renderer(s).

Starting with 2.0, this will display symbols by default. The default symbols
will require a nerd font to be installed. To change these symbols, you can set
the following properties:
>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      default_component_configs = {
        symbols = {
          -- Change type
          added     = "✚",
          deleted   = "✖",
          modified  = "",
          renamed   = "",
          -- Status type
          untracked = "",
          ignored   = "",
          unstaged  = "",
          staged    = "",
          conflict  = "",
        }
      }
    })
<
To change the color of these symbols, you can edit the corresponding highlight
groups:

    NeoTreeGitAdded
    NeoTreeGitConflict
    NeoTreeGitDeleted
    NeoTreeGitIgnored
    NeoTreeGitModified
    NeoTreeGitUntracked

If you'd like to disable certain symbols, you can set them to an empty string.
For example, it is actually redundant to show the change type if you use the
default behavior of highlighting the file name according to the change type.
The following config will remove those change type symbols:
>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      default_component_configs = {
        symbols = {
          -- Change type
          added     = "",
          deleted   = "",
          modified  = "",
          renamed   = "",
          -- Status type
          untracked = "",
          ignored   = "",
          unstaged  = "",
          staged    = "",
          conflict  = "",
        }
      }
    })
<

To revert to the previous behavior of passing the git status through as-is
with codes like `[M ]` for changed/unstaged, and `[ M]` for changed/staged,
you can set the `symbols` property to nil or false:
>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      default_component_configs = {
        git_status = {
          symbols = false
        }
      }
    })
<

DIAGNOSTICS                                               *neo-tree-diagnostics*

By default, Neo-tree will display diagnostic symbols next to files. It will
display the highest severity level for files, and errors only for directories.
If you want to use symbols instead of "E", "W", "I", and H", you'll need to
define those somewhere in your nvim configuration. Here is an example:

>lua
    vim.fn.sign_define("LspDiagnosticsSignError",
        {text = " ", texthl = "LspDiagnosticsSignError"})
    vim.fn.sign_define("LspDiagnosticsSignWarning",
        {text = " ", texthl = "LspDiagnosticsSignWarning"})
    vim.fn.sign_define("LspDiagnosticsSignInformation",
        {text = " ", texthl = "LspDiagnosticsSignInformation"})
    vim.fn.sign_define("LspDiagnosticsSignHint",
        {text = "", texthl = "LspDiagnosticsSignHint"})
<

Alternatively, you can also specify the signs and/or highlights in the
neo-tree setup call like this:

>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      default_component_configs = {
        diagnostics = {
          symbols = {
            hint = "H",
            info = "I",
            warn = "!",
            error = "X",
          },
          highlights = {
            hint = "DiagnosticSignHint",
            info = "DiagnosticSignInfo",
            warn = "DiagnosticSignWarn",
            error = "DiagnosticSignError",
          },
        },
      }
    })
>
Anything not specified in the `default_component_configs` will fallback to the
`sign_define` method.

To disable this feature entirely, set `enable_diagnostics = false` in your
config when calling the setup function.


INDENT MARKERS                                      *neo-tree-indent-markers*

By default, indent markers (aka indent guides) are disabled. In Neo-tree
indent is a component, so to enable indent markers, you need configure the
`indent` component:

...at the global level:
>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      default_component_configs = {
        indent = {
          with_markers = true,
          indent_marker = "│",
          last_indent_marker = "└",
          indent_size = 2,
        },
      },
    })
<

...or in each renderer:
>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      filesystem = {
        renderers = {
          directory = {
            {
              "indent",
              with_markers = true,
              indent_marker = "│",
              last_indent_marker = "└",
              indent_size = 2,
            },
            -- other components
          },
          file = {
            {
              "indent",
              with_markers = true,
              indent_marker = "│",
              last_indent_marker = "└",
              indent_size = 2,
            },
            -- other components
          },
        }
      }
    })
<

You also can change the marker characters. To do this, you need change
`indent_marker` and `last_indent_marker` settings.

To change highlight of indent markers, you need configure `NeoTreeIndentMarker`
highlight group. By default, it refers to `Normal` highlight.


EXPANDERS                                                   *neo-tree-expanders*
Is hightly recommended enable if file nesting is enabled (this is the default
behavior if `with_expanders` is nil). The config can be done inside the `indent`
component:
>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      default_component_configs = {
        indent = {
          with_expanders = true,
          expander_collapsed = "",
          expander_expanded = "",
          expander_highlight = "NeoTreeExpander",
        },
      },
    })
<

HIGHLIGHTS                                                 *neo-tree-highlights*

The following highlight groups are defined by this plugin. If you set any of
these yourself before the plugin loads, it will not be touched. If they do not
exist, they will be created.

                          is set to another style than "NC". This is derived
                          from NeoTreeFloatBorder.
NeoTreeTitleBar           Used for the title bar of pop-ups, when the border-style
                          is set to "NC". This is derived from NeoTreeFloatBorder.
NeoTreeGitAdded           File name when the git status is added.
NeoTreeGitConflict        File name when the git status is conflict.
NeoTreeGitDeleted         File name when the git status is deleted.
NeoTreeGitIgnored         File name when the git status is ignored.
NeoTreeGitModified        File name when the git status is modified.
NeoTreeGitUnstaged        Used for git unstaged symbol.

EVENTS                                                        *neo-tree-events*

Events are one way to customize the behavior of Neo-tree. You can add event
handlers to your config in the `event_handlers` section, which should be a list
of objects in the form:

>lua
    {
      event = "event_name",
      handler = function(arg)
        -- do something, the value of arg varies by event.
      end,
      id = "optional unique id, only meaningful if you want to unsubscribe later"
    }
<

The following events are available:

"before_render"~
Fired after items have been collected from the source but before drawing the
nodes of the tree. This is the best place to gather additional data to be used
by components. The argument passed is the state of the source, which is also
passed to components and commands down the line.

"after_render"~
Fired after the tree has been rendered. The argument passed is the state of the
source, which is also passed to components and commands down the line.

"file_added"~
Fired after a file (or folder) has been created, either by using the "add"
command or by copy and paste. The arg is the full path to the new file.

"file_deleted"~
Fired after a file (or folder) has been deleted. The arg is the full path to the
deleted file.

"file_moved"~
Fired after a file (or folder) has been moved. The arg is a table containing
`source` and `destination` properties.

"file_open_requested"~
Fired just before a file is opened. The arg is a table containing the `state`
of the source being used, the `path` of the file to be opened, and `open_cmd`,
which is the open command that was requested. `open_cmd` will be either |edit|,
|split|, |vsplit|, |tabnew|. This function should return a table with a property called
`handled` which is true if the file open operation was handled, or false if it
was not. If `{ handled = true }` is not returned, the file will be opened using
the built-in logic.

"file_opened"~
Fired after a file has been opened. You might use this to auto-close the window
or clear the filter. The arg is the path of the file opened.

"file_renamed"~
Fired after a file (or folder) has been renamed. The arg is an table containing
`source` and `destination` properties.

"neo_tree_window_before_open"~
Fired before opening a new Neo-tree window. Called with the following arg:
                                                     *neo-tree-window-event-args*
The event argument for all window events is a table with the following keys:
    `winid`    = the |winid| of the window being opened or closed.
    `tabid`    = id of the tab that the window is in.
    `tabnr`    = (deprecated) number of the tab that the window is in.
    `source`   = the name of the source that is in the window, such as "filesystem".
    `position` = the position of the window, i.e. "left", "bottom", "right".

"neo_tree_window_after_open"~
Fired after opening a new Neo-tree window. Called with 
|neo-tree-window-event-args|.

"neo_tree_window_before_close"~
Fired before closing a Neo-tree window. Called with 
|neo-tree-window-event-args|.

"neo_tree_window_after_close"~
Fired after closing a Neo-tree window. Called with 
|neo-tree-window-event-args|.

NOTE: The following events are used internally and not intended for end user
usage. You can use them if you want, but beware that they may be debounced, and
the details of how frequently they are fired and what events are dropped will be
changed without warning.

"vim_diagnostic_changed"~
Fired on the |DiagnosticChanged| autocmd event. The arg is a table with one
property: `diagnostics_lookup`, which is a table where the keys are file names
and the values are tables with diagnostic counts by severity level.

"vim_buffer_changed"~
Fired on the following autocmd events: |BufDelete|, |BufWritePost|,
|BufFilePost|, |BufNew|

"vim_buffer_enter"~
Fired on the following autocmd events: |BufEnter|, |BufWinEnter|

"vim_dir_changed"~
Fired on the |DirChanged| autocmd event

"vim_win_enter"~
Fired on the |WinEnter| autocmd event

"vim_colorscheme"~
Fired on the |ColorScheme| autocmd event


You can also define your own with:
>
>lua
    require("neo-tree.events.queue").define_event(event_name, {
      setup = <function>,
      seed = <function>,
      teardown = <function>,
      debounce_frequency = <number>,
      once = <boolean>,
      cancelled = <boolean>
    })
<

The setup function is run the first time the event is subscribed to. For an
autocmd event, this would define the vim autocmd to connect it to fire_event().

The `seed` function is run at the beginning of every event firing. The diagnostics
event uses this to collect the diagnostic information and pass it to all
subscribers.

The `teardown` function is used when the last subscriber unsubscribes, and cleans
up. This is like Dispose in other languages.

`debounce_frequency` is the minimum number of milliseconds between each invocation
of the event. The first event is guaranteed to fire, as well as the last one, but
in between events may be dropped if this is set to a number greater than zero.

`once` means to only fire this event handler once then mark it as `cancelled`.

`cancelled` means that this event handler will be skipped in all future event
fires, and will be discarded on the next cleanup of the queue.


COMPONENTS AND RENDERERS                                   *neo-tree-renderers*

A renderer is just a list of component configs, to be rendered in order to
create a line in the tree. Each renderer is for a specific node type, such as
`directory` or `file`.  To view the available built-in components and their
configs for each source, check:
https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim/blob/v1.x/lua/neo-tree/defaults.lua

A default `renderers` config is specified at the root level and will be used
by each source unless another renderer is defined. If you just want to
rearrange or remove components, you can do so by changing these `renderers`
configs.

                                                           *neo-tree-components*
A component is a function that returns a single text object:
>lua
    {
      text = "Node A",
      highlight = "Normal"
    }
<

... or a list of text objects:
>lua
    {
      {
        text = "Node Name",
        highlight = "Directory"
      },
      {
        text = "[",
        highlight = "Comment"
      },
      {
        text = "I'm Special!",
        highlight = "SpecialChar"
      },
        text = "[",
        highlight = "Comment"
      }
    }
<

The only reason to return a list of objects is to use multiple highlight groups.
These components and renderers are defined per source by passing them in the
setup. If you define a component with the same name of a built-in component, it
will replace that built-in component. Otherwise it will be added to the existing
set of components.

CONTAINER                                                   *neo-tree-container*

One unique component that deserves some explanation is the `container`
component. This component allows you to create more complex layouts where
components can overlap, have a specific size, or be right aligned. A container
has the following properties:

width~
Width can be specified as a number, meaning actual number of characters, a
string containing a percentage such as `"100%"`, or the special string
`"fit_content"`. The percentage value means percentage of remaining space in
the window. If a window is 40 columns wide, and the rendered content for the
node so far equals 15 characters, then 100% would evaluate to 25 characters.

The `"fit_content"` value means that it will be the width of the largest
layer. See `zindex` for details about layers.

If the current position is "current", meaning it is being displayed in a split
instead of as a sidebar, the available width will be calculated as the longest
node name + indent + 8 characters. This is to prevent right aligned components
from being too far away from the node name.

min_width / max_width~
This constrains the value of width, useful when the `width` is set to a
percentage or `"fit_content"`.

content~
This is a list of components that will be arranged by this container.

Each component in the content list can use these additional properties:

  zindex~
  All components with the same zindex will be rendered together in the same
  layer, one after the other. Higher zindex value are rendered on top of other
  layers, hiding whatever is beneath them. For example, if a component with a
  zindex of 10 produces this:
>
  "abcdefg"
<
  and another component width a zindex of 20 produces this:
>
  "1234"
<
  then the result will be:
>
  "1234efg"
<
  
  align~
  If align is right, then it will be pushed to the right edge of the available
  space. This makes the most sense when the container width is set to a number
  or `"100%"`. Components that are right aligned will automatically overlap left
  aligned components with the same zindex if there is not enough space.
  
  Continuing with the example from above, if there was a `"right"` aligned
  component with a zindex of 20 that outputs:
>
  "**""
<
  Then the result when a container has a width of 12 would be:
>
  "1234efg   **"
<
  but if the width was 8 then the result would be:
>
  "1234ef**"
<

Example~

This example container has the name on the left hand side, and the
diagnostics and git status aligned to the right hand side of the window. The
diagnostics and git_status will always be shown, and the name will be clipped if
there is not enough space:
>lua
      {
        "container",
        width = "100%",
        right_padding = 1,
        content = {
          {
            "name",
            use_git_status_colors = true,
            zindex = 10
          },
          { "diagnostics",  zindex = 20, align = "right" },
          { "git_status", zindex = 20, align = "right" },
        },
      }
<


CUSTOM COMPONENTS

Each component function is called with the following args:
  `config` The config object defined in the renderer. This is how a component
  can be made to be configurable. This is useful if you want different behavior
  in a directory renderer vs a file renderer. The config is a combination of any
  options specified in the default_component_configs
  (|neo-tree-default-component-configs|), which can be overridden by settings
  specified within each renderer config.

  `node` The NuiNode object for this node. The properties can vary by source, but
  each one will generally have at least id and name properties.

  `state` This is the state of the plugin. This object is persistent for the
  life of the source, with one state object per source per tab. the entirety of
  all state and source level configuration is in this one object. Aside from
  configuration, it can also hold anything you may want to set in a
  "before_render" event.

For example, here is the simplest possible component:

>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      filesystem = {
        components = {

          name = function(config, node)
            return { 
              text = node.name,
              highlight = "NeoTreeFileName"
            }
          end

        }
      }
    })
<

For a more complete example, here is the actual built-in `name` component, which
is much more dynamic and configurable:

>lua
    require("neo-tree").setup({
      filesystem = {
        components = {

          name = function(config, node, state)
            local highlight = config.highlight or highlights.FILE_NAME
            if node.type == "directory" then
              highlight = highlights.DIRECTORY_NAME
            end
            if node:get_depth() == 1 then
              highlight = highlights.ROOT_NAME
            else
              if config.use_git_status_colors == nil or config.use_git_status_colors then
                local git_status = state.components.git_status({}, node, state)
                if git_status and git_status.highlight then
                  highlight = git_status.highlight
                end
              end
            end
            return {
              text = node.name,
              highlight = highlight,
            }
          end

        }
      }
    })

BUFFER VARIABLES                                     *neo-tree-buffer-variables*

Neo-tree sets certain buffer options and variables that you may use in custom
code or integrations if you need it. The |filetype| of the main window is
`neo-tree`. The buffer will also have these local variables set:

`winid` The window handle of the window that it was created in.
`tabid` The id of the tab that it was created in.
`tabnr` (deprecated) The number of the tab that it was created in.
`source` The name of the source that created it, i.e. filesystem, buffers, etc.

Please note that if the buffer is displayed in another window or tab, it's
behavior is unpredictable. It is meant to be locked to it's original location,
which is why those variables are recorded.


POPUPS                                                         *neo-tree-popups*

Popups will be created with a |filetype| of `neo-tree-popup`. You can use this
as the target for autocmds or to exclude them from being acted upon by other
plugins.

They can also be configured by setting the `popup_border_style` in your config,
and the colors of that border are controlled by the `NeoTreeFloatBorder`
highlight group. If you you use the special `NC` option for
`popup_border_style`, the title bar of that popup uses the `NeoTreeTitleBar`
highlight group.
