# Neo-tree.nvim

Neo-tree is a Neovim plugin to browse the file system and other tree like
structures in whatever style suits you, including sidebars, floating windows,
netrw split style, or all of them at once!

## Minimal Quickstart

#### Minimal Example for Packer:
```lua
use {
  "nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim",
    branch = "v2.x",
    requires = { 
      "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
      "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", -- not strictly required, but recommended
      "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
    }
  }
```

After installing, run:
```
:Neotree
```

Press `?` in the Neo-tree window to view the list of mappings.

_The above configuration is not everything that can be changed, it's just the
parts you might want to change first._


See `:h neo-tree` for full documentation. You can also preview that online at
[doc/neo-tree.txt](doc/neo-tree.txt), although it's best viewed within vim.


To see all of the default config options with commentary, you can view it online
at [lua/neo-tree/defaults.lua](lua/neo-tree/defaults.lua). You can also paste it
into a buffer after installing Neo-tree by running: 

```
:lua require("neo-tree").paste_default_config()
```

## The `:Neotree` Command

The single `:Neotree` command accepts a range of arguments that give you full
control over the details of what and where it will show. For example, the following 
command will open a file browser on the right hand side, "revealing" the currently
active file:

```
:Neotree filesystem reveal right
```

Arguments can be specified as either a key=value pair or just as the value. The
key=value form is more verbose but may help with clarity. For example, the command
above can also be specified as:

```
:Neotree source=filesystem reveal=true position=right
```

All arguments are optional and can be specified in any order. If you issue the command
without any arguments, it will use default values for everything. For example:

```
:Neotree
```

will open the filesystem source on the left hand side and focus it, if you are using 
the default config.

### Tab Completion

Neotree supports tab completion for all arguments. Once a given argument has a value,
it will stop suggesting those completions. It will also offer completions for paths.
The simplest way to disambiguate a path from another type of argument is to start
them with `/` or `./`.

### Arguments

Here is the full list of arguments you can use:

#### `action`
What to do. Can be one of:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| focus | Show and/or switch focus to the specified Neotree window. DEFAULT |
| show  | Show the window, but keep focus on your current window. |
| close | Close the window(s) specified. Can be combined with "position" and/or "source" to specify which window(s) to close. |

#### `source`
What to show. Can be one of:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| filesystem | Show a file browser. DEFAULT |
| buffers    | Show a list of currently open buffers. |
| git_status | Show the output of `git status` in a tree layout. |

#### `position`
Where to show it, can be one of:

| Option  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| left     | Open as left hand sidebar. DEFAULT |
| right    | Open as right hand sidebar. |
| top      | Open as top window. |
| bottom   | Open as bottom window. |
| float    | Open as floating window. |
| current  | Open within the current window, like netrw or vinegar would. |

#### `dir`
The directory to set as the root/cwd of the specified window. If you include a
directory as one of the arguments, it will be assumed to be this option, you
don't need the full dir=/path. You may use any value that can be passed to the
'expand' function, such as `%:p:h:h` to specify two directories up from the
current file. For example:

```
:Neotree ./relative/path
:Neotree /home/user/relative/path
:Neotree dir=/home/user/relative/path
:Neotree position=current dir=relative/path
```

#### `git_base`
The base that is used to calculate the git status for each dir/file.
By default it uses `HEAD`, so it shows all changes that are not yet committed.
You can for example work on a feature branch, and set it to `main`. It will
show all changes that happened on the feature branch and main since you 
branched off.

Any git ref, commit, tag, or sha will work.

```
:Neotree main
:Neotree v1.0
:Neotree git_base=8fe34be
:Neotree git_base=HEAD
```

#### `reveal`
This is a boolean flag. Adding this will make Neotree automatically find and 
focus the current file when it opens.

#### `reveal_file`
A path to a file to reveal. This supersedes the "reveal" flag so there is no
need to specify both. Use this if you want to reveal something other than the
current file. If you include a path to a file as one of the arguments, it will
be assumed to be this option. Like "dir", you can pass any value that can be
passed to the 'expand' function. For example:

```
:Neotree reveal_file=/home/user/my/file.text
:Neotree position=current dir=%:p:h:h reveal_file=%:p
:Neotree current %:p:h:h %:p
```

One neat trick you can do with this is to open a Neotree window which is
focused on the file under the cursor using the `<cfile>` keyword:

```
nnoremap gd :Neotree float reveal_file=<cfile>
```

See `:h neo-tree-commands` for details and a full listing of available arguments.

### File Nesting

See `:h neo-tree-file-nesting` for more details about file nesting.


### Netrw Hijack

```
:edit .
:[v]split .
```

If `"filesystem.window.position"` is set to `"current"`, or if you have specified
`filesystem.hijack_netrw_behavior = "open_current"`, then any command
that would open a directory will open neo-tree in the specified window.


## Sources

Neo-tree is built on the idea of supporting various sources. Sources are
basically interface implementations whose job it is to provide a list of
hierarchical items to be rendered, along with commands that are appropriate to
those items.

### filesystem
The default source is `filesystem`, which displays your files and folders. This
is the default source in commands when none is specified.

This source can be used to:
- Browse the filesystem
- Control the current working directory of nvim
- Add/Copy/Delete/Move/Rename files and directories
- Search the filesystem
- Monitor git status and lsp diagnostics for the current working directory

### buffers
![Neo-tree buffers](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/resources/raw/main/images/Neo-tree-buffers.png)

Another available source is `buffers`, which displays your open buffers. This is
the same list you would see from `:ls`. To show with the `buffers` list, use:

```
:Neotree buffers
```

### git_status
This view take the results of the `git status` command and display them in a
tree. It includes commands for adding, unstaging, reverting, and committing.

The screenshot below shows the result of `:Neotree float git_status` while the 
filesystem is open in a sidebar:

![Neo-tree git_status](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/resources/raw/main/images/Neo-tree-git_status.png)

You can specify a different git base here as well. But be aware that it is not
possible to unstage / revert a file that is already committed.

```
:Neotree float git_status git_base=main
```

## Configuration and Customization

This is designed to be flexible. The way that is achieved is by making
everything a function, or a string that identifies a built-in function. All of the
built-in functions can be replaced with your own implementation, or you can 
add new ones.

Each node in the tree is created from the renderer specified for the given node
type, and each renderer is a list of component configs to be rendered in order. 
Each component is a function, either built-in or specified in your config. Those
functions simply return the text and highlight group for the component.

Additionally, there is an events system that you can hook into. If you want to
show some new data point related to your files, gather it in the
`before_render` event, create a component to display it, and reference that
component in the renderer for the `file` and/or `directory` type.

Details on how to configure everything is in the help file at `:h
neo-tree-configuration` or online at
[neo-tree.txt](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim/blob/main/doc/neo-tree.txt)

Recipes for customizations can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim/wiki/Recipes). Recipes include
things like adding a component to show the
[Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) index for files, or
responding to the `"file_opened"` event to auto clear the search when you open a
file.
